          <p>
            powerbuilding workouts are meant to both increase strength and spark muscle gain.
            A beginner getting into powerbuilding will usually need to focus more on compound movements, or lifts that involve the movement of more than one joint.

        A beginner getting into powerbuilding will usually need to focus more on compound movements, or lifts that involve the movement of more than one joint. They can still train with an aesthetic goal in mind, but the building of a strong foundation will lead to better long-term success. A stronger base will allow a lifter to truly hone in on and cater accessories to their weaknesses (found through compounds) while being able to handle higher amounts of volume and intensity.
<ul>
  <li>Training Days per Week: 3</li>
  <li>Compound Movements: Squat, Bench, and Deadlift</li>
  <li>Compound Sets x Reps: 4-6 sets, 6-8 reps</li>
  <li>Accessory Movements Per Workouts: 3-4 movements</li>
  <li>Accessory Sets x Reps: 3 sets, 8-15 reps</li>
</ul><br>

        As one gets more experienced, they can start to add more variety to their training (hence the extra training day). By adding an overhead pressing day, the lifter can give their shoulders and torso more attention. Or, if the legs are a weak point, skip the presses and hit up the squat rack. 

        <ul>
          <li>Training Days per Week: 4</li>
          <li>Compound Movements: Squat, Bench, Deadlift, Overhead Press, or a second squat day</li>
          <li>Compound Sets x Reps: 4-5 sets, 4-8 reps</li>
          <li>Accessory Volume: 3-5 movements</li>
          <li>Accessory Sets x Reps: 3-4 sets, 8-12 reps</li>
        </ul><br>

Advanced (>2 years of lifting)
An advanced lifter has a good amount of depth in their training history to utilize a powerbuilding program that cycles intensity and volume a little more frequently. In addition to building four days around the compound movements listed below, there?s also an additional building day for optimal muscle growth. On that day, the lifter can focus on more volume with less weight. 
<ul>
  <li>Training Days per Week: 4-5</li>
  <li>Compound Movements: Squat, Bench, Deadlift, Overhead Press, and building day</li>
  <li>Compound Sets x Reps: 4-5 sets, 3-6 reps</li>
  <li>Accessory Volume: 3-5 movements</li>
  <li>Accessory Sets x Reps: 3-4 sets, 6-12 reps</li>

            Strength exercise, also known as resistance training, is a type of physical activity that is designed to improve muscular strength, endurance, and power. It involves using resistance, such as weight or body weight, to contract the muscles against.

        Strength exercise, also known as resistance training, is a type of physical activity that is designed to improve muscular strength, endurance, and power. It involves using resistance, such as weight or body weight, to contract the muscles against. This can be done through a variety of exercises, including weightlifting, bodyweight exercises, and resistance band exercises. Strength training is an important part of overall fitness, and can help to improve bone density, increase muscle mass, and reduce the risk of injury. It is also beneficial for weight loss and can help improve cardiovascular health. It is typically recommended to engage in strength training two to three times per week, with one to two days of rest in between sessions to allow for proper muscle recovery.
